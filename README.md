# LOCATION TASK APPLICATION
The system discusses in detail about proposed Location Snoozer and Advance Geofencing. The
activity of user entering and exiting a geofence could trigger an alert or a notification or a Snoozer to
the userâ€™s device which triggers when the user is actually present near or at that specific location for
the work for which user has set the reminder. Timely reminder reduces chances of missing the location
of interest & task to be reminded can be performed at desired location. Also Ease of search is achieved
by finding nearby places of interest. The mobile application will be designed and implemented for an
online marketplace for proactive contextual services that allows users to easily find interesting services
by using GPS or RFID, can easily subscribe to it. The main objective of the research is to implement
an application for Android based smartphones and tablets which will trigger an alert to the device at
that specific location for the work for which user has set the reminder and addition to that let the user
know about the offers that are going on in nearby shops/malls by using k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN)
algorithm which will improve advertising performance for customers and which will increase sales and
business perspective efficiently.
